# marketplace
An online marketplace template written in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The project has a backend to handle client-server actions, like saving a created offer in an **SQLite3** database, a webserver to transfer the public files to the connecting users and a CDN server to store images of offers, profile pictures and such. The server side of the project is written in the **Elysia** framework in **TypeScript**, created for the **Bun** runtime.

# requirements
You're required to have these dependencies installed using `bun install` to succesfully start the marketplace template:
- `elysia`
- `@elysiajs/cors`
- `@elysiajs/static`

# running
To run the server, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and simply start the `index.ts` file using `bun run index.ts`.

# credits
This is a solo project. All credit goes to me.
